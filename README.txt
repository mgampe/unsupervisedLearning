Unsupervised Learning Experiements with sklearn

This document outlines the set up for the notebooks in this repository.

Data and code can be found online at https://github.com/mgampe/unsupervisedLearning

Please visit the site to download all necessary data and code. To run the code, place the data files in the same directory as the code and the run the script with the appropriate python interpreter. This was tested to run in VSCode and jupyter notebook.

Each notebook contains a script for reducing the dimensionality of a 2 datasets provided as CSV files utilizing differnet methods. Every script will run the algorithm in the title of the notebook, cluster the reduced data, and then train mulitple NNs in order to measure performance gain made from the UL algorithm.

python version: 3.8.2 64 bit

Data requirements: Provided with the code on github
NNData_87.csv
cfb22_nn_w1_w9.csv

Imports/Dependencies: Please ensure you have the following installed before running the notebook
numpy 
six
sys
mlrose
pandas
